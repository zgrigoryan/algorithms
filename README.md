# Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in C++, starting with **C++ STL algorithms** and later expanding to **Rosalind algorithms** and other algorithmic challenges.

## Structure
Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file within categorized directories for better organization.

### **Current Categories**
- **STL Implementations**: Implementations of standard library algorithms.
- **Rosalind Problems**: Solutions to Rosalind bioinformatics challenges.
- **Other Algorithms**: Additional algorithms beyond STL and Rosalind.
